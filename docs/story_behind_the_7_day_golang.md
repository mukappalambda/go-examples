**What I have learned from this?**

- Imitate a project from its earlier commits.
- Reduce the total amount of code to a beginner readable level (nearly 500 lines.)
- Try to ignore the part of complicated error handling, or re-write some logic of data structures or algorithms that are meant to increase the performance but require a huge amount of code at first time.
- Use the techniques taught from the book [Mini Habits](https://itig-iraq.iq/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini-Habits.pdf) to stick to the project.
