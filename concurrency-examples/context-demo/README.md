# Context Demo

This markdown collects a number of materials related to the `context` package, and records how I learn its usage at the first time.

## Materials

- [Go Concurrency Patterns: Context](https://go.dev/blog/context)
- [Geektutu: Go Context 並發編程簡明教程](https://geektutu.com/post/quick-go-context.html), Simplified Chinese

## A Great Way to Learn

Go to the context [source code](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.17.6:src/context/), and learn how to use them through test cases directly.

## TODO

- [ ] Add the example codes to master these concepts.
