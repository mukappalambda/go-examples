## Guideline

- Go Developer Roadmap: https://roadmap.sh/golang

So, basic question, how to learn Go?

Currently, I would search articles/explanations from the following sources:

- [Awesome Go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go), A curated list of awesome Go frameworks, libraries and software.
- [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- [Go Doc](https://go.dev/doc/)
- [Go FAQ](https://go.dev/doc/faq)
- [Go Wiki](https://go.dev/wiki/), a collection of information about the Go Programming Language.
- [The Go Blog](https://go.dev/blog/)
- [Good First Issue / Go](https://goodfirstissue.dev/language/go)

Basically, all the intermediate-to-advanced knowledge already resides in there.
